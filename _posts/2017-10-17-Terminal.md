title: Introduction to the Terminal
---

####What is the terminal?####
Also known as the **Console, Shell, Command Line, Command Prompt**

The terminal is an interface to execute text based commands.  This is how programmers interacted with computers before the invention of the graphical user interface (GUI) which now dominates the industry now (Microsoft Windows, Apple OSX, etc)
Unless you are familiar with writing code, terminal usage usually starts with "I need to run a program but Google/Friend/Colleague says that I can only run it using the terminal".  Once you get past this part, you will find that the terminal can make your life a lot easier if you know how to use it!
Basic advantages of using the terminal include:
* Ability to perform operations on many files all at once 
* Running scripts to do repetitive operations
* Scheduling operations to run at predetermined times
* Speed up simple processes like searching, editing, renaming, copying and deleting files

####Opening a terminal session####
I will write this initial post biased to using OSX (Windows to follow).

All Mac computers come with a pre-installed Terminal application, open this using the searchlight:
