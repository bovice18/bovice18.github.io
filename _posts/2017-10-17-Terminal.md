title: Introduction to the Terminal
---
*This is a Mac OSX specific tutorial as the Windows cmd is quite different*
## What is the terminal? ##
Also known as the **Console, Shell, Command Line, Command Prompt**

The terminal is an interface to execute text based commands.  This is how programmers interacted with computers before the invention of the graphical user interface (GUI) which dominates the industry now (Microsoft Windows, Apple OSX, etc)

Basic advantages of using the terminal include:
* Ability to perform operations on many files all at once 
* Running scripts to do repetitive operations
* Scheduling operations to run at predetermined times
* Speed up simple processes like searching, editing, renaming and deleting files
* Connect to remote computers or servers

## Opening a terminal session ##
**Mac:** Use the searchlight to find the terminal

## Navigation ##
Lets play with some very simple terminal commands:
* **pwd** - "print working directory" Prints the current folder (directory) of your command prompt
* **whoami** - Prints the current user
* **ls** - Lists the contents of the working directory
* **ls -l** - List contents and details of contents
* **cd** ***directoryname*** - "change directory" Move command prompt into sub-directory
* **cd ..** - Move command prompt back one directory

Below my terminal you can see the same folder structure that is displayed in my terminal window.
Notice the prompt **bwood@beaus-mbp:~$** shows the "*~*" character as my current working directory at the beginning.
*~* is an alias for your "home" working directory, by default mine is **/Users/bwood** as you can see when I run **pwd**

Practice navigating your folders using the command line

*TIP 1: use the tab key to auto-fill directories and files.  Double tab to see options to complete the argument*

*TIP 2: pass in the full path of a directory or file to jump to it*

*TIP 3: press the up arrow to see previous commands you have run*

## Opening Files ##
Use **open** to open a file using the default program:

![Open]({{ "/images/openFile.gif" }})

## Using a builtin text editor ##
The command line has a few different builtin text editors.  I am going to demonstrate the vi Editor

* **vi** ***filename*** - to open an existing or new text file
* **a** - toggle *INSERT* mode
* **esc key** - toggle out of edit mode
* **:q** - quit vi
* **:q!** - quit without saving changes
* **:wq** - quit and save changes
