title: Amazon Elastic Beanstalk Development Notes
---

Elastic Beanstalk is an AWS service that allows quick and easy deployment and scale of web applications in the AWS cloud

## Deploying a Django App ##
*Pre-req 1:* `sudo pip install awsebcli`

*Pre-req 2:* Create a Django application that runs locally in a virtual environment

1. Save a text file of required packages/versions for running your application (based on virtualenv)
```
(eb-virt) ~/django-project pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
2. Create a new directory, called ~/django-project/.ebextensions
3. Create a new file called ~/django-project/.ebextensions/django.config
```
option_settings:
  aws:elasticbeanstalk:container:python:
    WSGIPath: django-project/wsgi.py
    ```
4. Deactivate virtualenv:
```
~/django-project$ deactivate
```
5. Initialize EB repo:
```
eb init -p python2.7 <project-name>
```
6. Run eb init again to create a key pair for deployed instance:
```
~/django-project$ eb init
Do you want to set up SSH for your instances?
(y/n): y
Select a keypair.
1) my-keypair
2) [ Create new KeyPair ]
```
7. Create new EB environment:
```
eb create <project-name>
```
*This will take a few minutes
8. Open browser to EB env:
```
~/django-project$ eb open
```
9. Terminate the EB environment (to save money)
```
~/django-project$ eb terminate <project-name>
```
